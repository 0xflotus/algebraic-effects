# What, Why and How
Here are the answers to some common questions you may have about the library

---


### The "what"
Algebraic effects is an alternative way to model your side-effects in a composible way. Having the operation signature independent of the operation behaviour is what makes the idea so powerful.


### The "why"
The concept of algebraic effects and the ideas it promotes have been gaining a lot of popularity recently and pushing that to overdrive is the direction that the react community is taking. With React Fiber, Suspense, React hooks, etc., everything is pointing to "algebraic effects is the future".


### What does {some_weird_confusing_word} mean?
I've got you covered. These new weird made-up words in the world of functional programming make it sound very over-whelming. Trust me, its not. I've tried to explain the important ones [here](#lingo)


### What about redux-saga?
<Link to="https://github.com/phenax/algebraic-effects" isExternal>algebraic-effects</Link> and <Link to="https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/" isExternal>redux-saga</Link> come from the same hole in functional programming. One can say that algebraic effects is to redux-saga what a set of bricks are to a house. You can use algebraic effects without redux, as a effects framework that allows you to manage side-effects in a clean way.
